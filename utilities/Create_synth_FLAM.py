#This is a tool to create quick and dirty FLAM outputs - data is randomly generated rather than based on SatSim. Follows the following broad steps:
# 1. Generates a set of connection matrices by giving a chance to toggle a connection each timestep (eg. isn't just totally random, it's evolving)
# 2. At the start of a round, picks a random Sat to be the PS.
# 3. zeros a number of Matrices as defined by training_time
# 4. Counts the number of steps it takes for all devices to connect to the PS
# 5. Returns to step 2 until all timesteps are done, then outputs as CSV
